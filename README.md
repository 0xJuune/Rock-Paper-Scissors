# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is another project that's a part of The Odin Project coursework. The goal is to create a game of "Rock Paper Scissors" in JavaScript. 

-Must have a computer player that randomly selects an input.
-Must have a text-input for user's selection.*
-Must have a "Best-of-5" mode.
-Must report who the winner is and keep score. 

*Later on we'll be adding graphics, but in the current version it's just based in the console. Text-input may be replaced with mouse-based selection.


My plan with this project currently is to approach it in a more scalable way. Instead of defining every combination by hand, just setting up a system to where it's simple to add "hands" in the code, and not have to fully write the logic for win/loss conditions between all possible combinations.
